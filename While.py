#Basics
i = 1 #Assigns the variable i to refer to 1
while i <= 10: #This code will run until i is less than or equal to 5
  print(i) #Print the value for i on every loop
  i += 1 #Add 1 to the current value of i every iteration

while i <= 10: #The code below will run as long as i is less than or equal to 10
  print(i * "*") #This will multiply the string * by i times each time
  i += 1 #Increases the value of i by 1 on every iteration
